\lowertitleback{{\scriptsize{}This book is an advanced tutorial
on functional programming in System Fω using Dhall.}\\
%{\scriptsize{}~}\\
{\scriptsize{}The book's topics include an overview of Dhall's type system;
techniques for numerical calculations;
techniques for encoding recursive types and code in System Fω;
implementation of various combinators and typeclass derivation for functors, monads, and other
typeclasses;
and some basic applications of dependent types.}\\
%{\scriptsize{}~}\\
{\scriptsize{}The book shows many code examples that have been validated by the Dhall interpreter.}\\
